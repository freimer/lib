// Package kind_configs contains the API representations of resource kind configs. This package exists purely so that
// the previewer can expose endpoints that the web app can use to create/modify resources, and we should remove this
// eventually, once the web app has been updated to use the "exported" resources in lib/pkg/resources/kinds.
